# Test App

SPA that collects, and stores data from user input

## Note

I don't see any reasons for error handling here. 'Cause we have CRUD operations to redux store. I can't imagine the circumstances under which working with the store could cause an error.

## Technologies

- React
- Redux (Redux-Persist)

## Development

1. Clone Repository `git clone https://github.com/Ktyby/test-app.git`
2. Install npm `yarn`
3. Run project `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) to view it in the browser.

## Support

If you have suggestions, you can open issues on github.
